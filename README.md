# DM-GY 6063 B Creative Coding

Fall 2015 / Thursdays 6:30-9:20pm MAGNET 825

Your professor: [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/). E-mail me: [aparrish@nyu.edu](mailto:aparrish@nyu.edu).

Office hours: Wednesdays, 4pm to 5:30pm at MAGNET (adjunct's work area)

##Course description

This course is an introductory programming class, appropriate for students with
no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming
teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe
the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In this course, students are
trained to go beyond this sequential thinking, to think concurrently and
modularly. By its end, students are empowered to write and read code for
event-driven, object-oriented, graphical user interfaces.

## IDM program objectives

Students will:

* Develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in
  order to solve problems or create  opportunities.

* Develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.

* Develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and
  position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and
  technological contexts.

* Gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing
  their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and
  presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

* Develop **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team
  or group.

## Course objectives

Students in this course will:

* Understand the basics of creative coding in Javascript (p5.js/node.js).
* Apply their understanding of digital media to software.
* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven,
  object-oriented, real time framework.
* Experiment with different techniques for user input and output, including
  sensors and non-traditional screens.
* Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

## Methodology

The course is presented in a tutorial format: most class sessions will consist
of the instructor demonstrating and explaining some aspect of computer
programming. The first seven weeks of the course are centered around basic
programming concepts, with a focus on computer visuals; following that, the
approach of the course is oriented toward particular topics. (These topics are
subject to change as the interests of the students become more clear.)

We'll also be critiquing student work in-class, generally in an informal way
and on a volunteer basis.

## Technology

We'll be learning [p5.js](http://p5js.org/), a Javascript port of the perennial
favorite [Processing](https://processing.org/).

There are lots of ways to program with p5.js. We're going to try out the p5.js
editor. [Download it here](http://p5js.org/download/#editor) (for Mac and PC).

## Requirements

* Students are responsible for ten weekly assignments, each of which is
  designed to give students the opportunity to demonstrate and deepen their
  mastery of the technical topics presented in class.
* Students must document their work using the IDM wordpress installation on
  [http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu](http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/) (or similar
  blogging site)
* In the last week of class, students will present a final project. The shape, 
  form, and content of the final project are left up to the student, but the
  project should demonstrate significant mastery over the technical concepts
  discussed in class. Students are responsible for presenting their project in
  class *and* for accompanying documentation of the project (including the
  full source code). More details on this as the semester progresses!

##Assignments

The assignments are your opportunity to be on the hook for putting your skills
to the test. They're designed to test and deepen your knowledge while giving me
valuable information about how you're progressing in the class.

[Turn in your assignments using this Google
Form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jEqJ5a88ZY_GI-7bbdJihJbTv2rnjYCTCHAwc3ZQmR8/viewform?usp=send_form)

Specific requirements for assignments:

* Each assignment should be accompanied by a blog post that documents your
  process in fulfilling the assignment's objectives.
* You'll need somewhere to upload your completed sketches. If you already have
  your own web hosting service ([DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), say),
  that's great! If not, I'll show you how to set up a
  [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) account in class.
* Assignments must be turned in *before class* on the day they're due. Late
  assignments will not be accepted.
* Assignments will be graded on their technical mastery and creativity.

## Reading

There is no assigned textbook for this class, but I may assign one-off readings
throughout the semester for in-class discussion. If you're the kind of student
that benefits from having a textbook close at hand, please buy [Make: Getting
Started with p5.js: Making Interactive Graphics in JavaScript and
Processing](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Interactive-Graphics-JavaScript-Processing/dp/1457186772/), by Lauren McCarthy, Ben Fry, and Casey Reas (when it's
released!).

If you're looking for other supplementary sources of programming knowledge and
exercises, [refer to Katherine Bennet's excellent list of
resources](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-UY1133-B_CreativeCodingFA15/blob/master/dm113-B_Resources.md).

## Grading policy

| Component | Percentage |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Attendance and participation | 30% |
| IDM Coursework Documentation | 5% |
| Assignments | 10 x 4% = 40% |
| Final project | 25% |

## Attendance, lateness and in-class behavior

### Attendance

You are expected to attend all class sessions. Absences due to non-emergency
situations will only be cleared if you let me know a week (or more) in advance,
and even then only for compelling personal or professional reasons (e.g.,
attending an important conference, going to a wedding). If you're unable to
attend class due to contagious or incapacitating illness, please let me know
(by e-mail) before class begins.

Each unexcused absence will deduct 5% from your final grade. If you have three
or more unexcused absences, you risk failing the course.

### Lateness

Be on time to class. If you're more than fifteen minutes late, or if you leave
early (without my clearance), it will count as an unexcused absence.

### In-class behavior

Laptops must be closed while your fellow students are presenting work. You're
otherwise welcome to use laptops in class, but only to follow along with the
in-class tutorials and to take notes. ([Keeping all of this in
mind.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368))

### Procedures should punch up

Read Leonard Richardson's [Bots should punch
up](http://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0). "You can poke fun at yourself
(Stephen Colbert famously said 'There's no status I would not surrender for a
joke'), you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status
than you, but if you mock someone with lower status, it's not cool." Be
sensitive to what your classmates might find offensive, triggering, or violent;
be graceful and listen carefully when your work gets called out.

##Academic Integrity

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty
policy](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty) in its
entirety. For the purposes of this class, "plagiarism" that violates the
academic integrity policy is defined as representing someone else's code (or
other procedure) as your own. (We will, of course, liberally be using media that
other people have created as source material for our code and procedures—this
does not violate the academic integrity policy. You are, however, expected to
cite the sources of these materials where possible and appropriate.)

##Disability accommodations

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please
contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at
212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu. You must be registered with CSD to receive
accommodations. Information about the Moses Center can be found at
http://www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd
floor.
